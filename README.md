This is web traversal drivers an effort made for the automation testers

    - To traverse specific set of elements(eg navbar) on webpage.
    - Snapshot comparison
    - Find subimage co-ordinates from fullpage snapshot image
    - Click specific co-ordinate on screen
    - OCR

This framework is using Selenium,PIL(python image library) and Tesseract to facilitate above features.
I would love to add more features to it so require more suggestions, contribution and improvements.

Thanks,

@vvr
